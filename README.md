## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

[Install Peacock for VS Code HERE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock&wt.mc_id=vscodepeacock-github-jopapa).

## Running the MCP Server hosted in GitHub Copilot with VS Code Insiders

> **Note**: If you already have the MCP server enabled with Claude Desktop, add `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled: true` in your VS Code settings and it will discover existing MCP server lists.

If you want to associate the MCP server with a specific repo, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with this content:

```json
{
  "inputs": [],
  "servers": {
    "peacock-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      // "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@johnpapa/peacock-mcp"
        // "_git/peacock-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to associate the MCP server with all repos, add the following to your VS Code User Settings JSON:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "peacock-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      // "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@johnpapa/peacock-mcp"
        // "/Users/papa/_git/peacock-mcp/dist/index.js"
        // "_git/peacock-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
"chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true,
```

### VS Code Manual Installation

> **Note**: For quick installation, click the install buttons at the top of this README.

        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@johnpapa/peacock-mcp"],
        "env": {}
      }
    }
  },
  "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true
}
```

#### Using CLI Commands

```

For VS Code Insiders:

```bash
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"peacock-mcp","command":"npx","args":["-y","@johnpapa/peacock-mcp"],"env":{}}'
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install Peacock MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@johnpapa/peacock-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @johnpapa/peacock-mcp --client claude
```

### Run the MCP Server Locally with MCP Inspector

If you'd like to run MCP Inspector locally to test the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnpapa/peacock-mcp
   ```

1. Install the required dependencies and build the project.

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

1. (Optional) To try out the server using MCP Inspector run the following command:

   ```bash
   # Start the MCP Inspector
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
   ```

   Visit the MCP Inspector URL shown in the console in your browser. Change `Arguments` to `dist/index.js` and select `Connect`. Select `List Tools` to see the available tools.

### Using Tools in GitHub Copilot

1. Now that the mcp server is discoverable, open GitHub Copilot and select the `Agent` mode (not `Chat` or `Edits`).
2. Select the "refresh" button in the Copilot chat text field to refresh the server list.
3. Select the "üõ†Ô∏è" button to see all the possible tools, including the ones from this repo.
4. Put a question in the chat that would naturally invoke one of the tools, for example:

   ```
   How do I set my VS Code accent colors?
   ```
