## Running the MCP Server hosted in GitHub Copilot with VS Code Insiders

> **Note**: If you already have the MCP server enabled with Claude Desktop, add `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled: true` in your VS Code settings and it will discover existing MCP server lists.

If you want to associate the MCP server with a specific repo, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with this content:

```json
{
  "inputs": [],
  "servers": {
    "peacock-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      // "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@johnpapa/peacock-mcp"
        // "_git/peacock-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to associate the MCP server with all repos, add the following to your VS Code User Settings JSON:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "peacock-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      // "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@johnpapa/peacock-mcp"
        // "/Users/papa/_git/peacock-mcp/dist/index.js"
        // "_git/peacock-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
"chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true,
```

### Using Tools in GitHub Copilot

1. Now that the mcp server is discoverable, open GitHub Copilot and select the `Agent` mode (not `Chat` or `Edits`).
2. Select the "refresh" button in the Copilot chat text field to refresh the server list.
3. Select the "üõ†Ô∏è" button to see all the possible tools, including the ones from this repo.
4. Put a question in the chat that would naturally invoke one of the tools, for example:

   ```
   How do I set my VS Code accent colors?
   ```
